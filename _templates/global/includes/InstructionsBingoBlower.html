            You will have noticed a Bingo Blower in the laboratory.
            In this Blower there are balls of three different colours:
            {{ Constants.human_colour_states.0|lower }}, {{ Constants.human_colour_states.1|lower }}
            and {{ Constants.human_colour_states.2|lower }}.
            The balls are constantly being blown about in the Blower.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            At the end of the experiment, when we come to play out your preferred choice on one of the
            questions, we will use this Bingo Blower to
            determine a colour: we will allow you to open the exit chute â€” this will lead to one ball being
            expelled.
            Obviously this expulsion will be done at random as there is no way that you can control the
            colour of the ball that emerges.
            The colour of the ball and the lottery that you chose on the question that was selected will
            determine your payment.
