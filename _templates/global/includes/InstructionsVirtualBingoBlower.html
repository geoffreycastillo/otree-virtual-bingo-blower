    You will notice a virtual Bingo Blower below.
    You can see there are balls of three different colours:
    {{ Constants.human_colour_states.0|lower }}, {{ Constants.human_colour_states.1|lower }}
    and {{ Constants.human_colour_states.2|lower }}.
    It is a real physics simulation and not a pre-recorded video, meaning that we have no control on how the balls move.

<p class="card-text">
    To convince yourself that this Bingo Blower is simulated in real-time,
    <strong>on this page only</strong>
    you can manipulate the balls by clicking on one, dragging it and seeing how the other balls react.
    Later on you will not be able to control the balls to prevent you from affecting the outcome.
</p>

<p class="card-text">
    At the end of the experiment, in order to determine a colour, the Bingo Blower will be stopped and the ball closest to the center selected.
    Since the Bingo Blower is a real physics simulation, we cannot control the colour of the ball drawn.
</p>

<p class="card-text">
    You can use the buttons below to see how drawing a ball will work.
    After you click on 'Draw a ball', the balls keep tumbling for 3 seconds.
    Thereafter the balls are frozen and the ball closest to the center is chosen.
    If you want to try drawing a ball multiple times, click on 'Reset the Blower'.
